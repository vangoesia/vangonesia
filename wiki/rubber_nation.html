      <h2>Founding of the Rubber Nation</h2>
      <p>After the transfer from Y5VG to Y6VG, Many Vango Gang members were unhappy with the way the Vango Gang was headed. Notable members such as Valentino left because threats started to be neutralised with Psychological Warfare, a change from the Physical Warfare the Vango Gang was known for. This happened because of the Integration of Jenson into the Vango Group (Friendship Group of the Vango Gang and Vangonesia) after the SÛS SHOP, run by Amajei (Parent Company of Vango Gang, Vangonesia, EXB Studios and More). The Vango Gang Intelligence forces operating as "Codename Bakerloo" found out about a new group coming known as the Rubber Nation, although the Risk Status was Set as Low at the time.</p>
      
      <h3>Leading up to the RN War</h3>
      <p>The Vangan Languague Authority assigned Rubber Nation the name "Ruserones nacíonal" in Vangan, Directly translating to "Rubber-Threat (Rusero is Rubber, and -ones indicates a threat) Country". </p>
